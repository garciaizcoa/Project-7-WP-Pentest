Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pen Testing Report

### 1. Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- [ ] Summary: 
Current versions of WordPress are vulnerable to a stored XSS. An
unauthenticated attacker can inject JavaScript in WordPress comments. The
script is triggered when the comment is viewed.

If triggered by a logged-in administrator, under default settings the
attacker can leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the
server via the plugin and theme editors.

Alternatively the attacker could change the administratorâ€™s password,
create new administrator accounts, or do whatever else the currently
logged-in administrator can do on the target system
